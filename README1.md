Problem Statement


Your task is to build a robust IoT log parser. You will be provided with a log file containing data from various sensors and devices, potentially including Base64 encoded images and web server logs. Your parser must extract, structure, and potentially visualize this data efficiently and accurately



I developed the above task using python and flask, it is a frmae work to develop the backend and html,css for frontend. The code i wrote is take a input log file form user and parser the log life and extract the data in file for sensors and devices ,which includes Base64 encoded images and webserver logs.the parser arser must extract, structure, and potentially visualize this data efficiently and accurately in form tables.



I use python for extracting of data and processing of data and Falsk for backend development . It take the log file and process the data and visulize.
